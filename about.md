## about me

I am a **geek**. **period**.  *drop mic*

now on a more serious note.  for the last 15+ years I have been a storage administrator, engineer, architect, or consultant.  in that same time period I have been a DBA, programmer, backup & recovery admin, data protection architect, disaster recovery specialist, manager, and other things that I have forgotten about.  that doesn't include what I did prior to doing storage work.  *I have been around the block a few times*.

this blog is my way of giving back to the community by allowing me to share my knowledge with you.  hopefully my battle scars and nightmares help you to avoid the same situations in the future.  *learn from my mistakes*.

I current hold certifications in [EMC]( http://emc.com ), [Pure Storage]( https://purestorage.com ), [Solidfire]( http://solidfire.com ), [Nimble]( https://nimblestorage.com ) [HPE]( http://hpe.com )and [VMware]( http://vmware.com ).  and more to *come soon*.  I have had lots of others but they have expired (or I refuse to acknowledge them).

### **NOTICE**

this blog/site does **NOT** reflect my employer or their opinions.  it is completely my own opinions.  I do **NOT** blog about my work in the office nor my customers, so don't even ask.  I don't and won't do it.
