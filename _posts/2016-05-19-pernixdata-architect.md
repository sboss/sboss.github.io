## what i/os are your vms doing?

so back at EMCWorld I met the *guys* at [PernixData]( http://pernixdata.com ).  smart people.  I was checking our their [Architect]( http://www.pernixdata.com/pernixdata-architect-software ) product.  looking at the marketing slicks and hearing the *elevator pitch* about the product I thought it was going to be *meh*.  it all sounded too good to be true.  so I cornered one of their architects (Andy) and asked him to give me a demo of the product.  not telling him I wasn't fully sold on the product yet.  **I was wrong**.  Architect is a great tool for any [VMWare]( http://vmware.com ) shop.  Not only can you see i/o rates at the ESX level but also at the VM level.  I can tell read and write rates at the various block sizes for *each and every vm*.  that is amazing.

now when an application owner says that they application is doing large block i/os, you can show them what exactly they are doing.  rates. sizes. everything.  now you can find that really chatty vm and talk to the owner about *what the hell are they doing*.

my recommendation is get with PernixData or one of their partners for a demo.  see if it is something you might like.  if so, install the demo version (fully functional for 30 days).  then you can see the details of your environment and see how you can save yourself money by not doing upgrades.
