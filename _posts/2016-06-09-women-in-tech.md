## what is your experiences with women in tech?

so several friends of mine have brought up the lack of women in tech.  I don't see it, err I mean I didn't see it.  I always worked places that people were hired based on skills & personality and not on gender, ethnic background, sexual preferences, etc.  so when people would talk about lack of women in tech I didn't see it.

now being an inquisitive person I started to keep an eye out on the issue.  and it is an issue.  **I was wrong**.

over the last few months I have been to a few very large tech conferences (north of 35k people at them) and multiple smaller ones (less than 1k).  the amount of women in tech was a very small percentage.  but that is after you delve down into the details.  At the very large conferences, I would see women in booths or in rooms that was about technology.  on the surface it looks like they are part of the women in tech group.  they weren't.  they were either marketing or sales and knew *nothing* about the products.  they just memorized some marketing/sales points about the product(s) that they would parrot out.  talk about disappointed.  I was disappointed that a company would bring someone to a conference to talk about their product(s) and that person was clueless.  I am a *geek* and want to talk to the fellow *geeks*.  secondly these women were skewing the perception on the percentage of women in tech.

**is our industry anti-women?** *I hope to ${deity} not!*

**what can we do to fix this issue?**

I don't have an answer for this.  I just want to help get the discussion started.
