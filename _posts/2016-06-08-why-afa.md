## why is everyone going AFA (All Flash Arrays)?

some vendors platforms have always been AFA (like [Pure Storage]( http://purestorage.com )).  Some started out as spinning disks (like [EMC]( http://emc.com )/[HPE]( http://hpe.com )/[NetApp]( http://netapp.com )).  Some where hybrids (like [Nimble]( http://nimblestorage.com )).  But it seems like everyone is moving to AFA.  **Why?**

it comes down to two things.  or at least this is my opinion.

1. no one (that manages storage) wants to be the blame for slow storage. now they can say "*you are on all flash, you are on the fastest storage around*", so **not me**.  and for the manager over the storage people or the storage people themselves, this is a easy win. put people on flash and then you can shift the blame to someone else.

2. SSD prices per gigabyte are dropping.  HPE just announced 7.8TB SSDs and 15TB drives will be out by end of the year (not sure when the storage vendors will support them but not too longer after that).  these large (capacity) drives take very little space, power or cooling.  and their price points are dropping.  the ROI on total costs (drive, cooling, power, space) with the 8TB SSDs (actuallty they are 7.8TB) is at the crossing point with spinning media.  plus they have a slower fail rate (less touching means less chances of human error).  once we get drives larger than 8TB, like the 15TB drives at the end of year, it will be cheaper to be on SSD than spinning media.  **holy crap** that is awesome.

now that is my opinion.  I have chatted with some fellow storaage peeps (SMEs/Experts) and they agree on one or both points.  no one has said I was an idiot for my point of view.

so why do you think everyone is going AFA?
