## HPE Discover is a first for me

so this is my first year at HP(e) Discover.  I have always heard good things about the conference from people I know and trust that went to it.  So I had high hopes for the conference.

good things:

* passed my HPE Storage ATP exam. (had to put that in there, not really relevant to anyone else).  the tests while at the conference are **free**.
* Access to various people to talk about the various technologies and solutions.
* lots of information about all the various technology tracks (network, security, servers, storage, software, DevOps, OpenStack(Helion), manufacturing, etc). You can't experience all the tracks.
* HPE is working on OpenStack (Helion) and getting all their hardware to be able to support it.  Not just servers, but storage, networking, security, etc.
* as a partner, I was invited to some special "partner" presentations about roadmaps.  I think that these could have been video'ed and presented over a controlled WebEX (or the like) and given us those hours to attend other sessions.  Even the "panels" at the end could have been done via WebEX.
* 3PAR now supports 7.8tb SSDs and 15tb SSDs by end of year.
* DevOps was also a big push. they want you to use *their* products but have support for using some of the more popular OSS ones (like jenkins).

non-good things:

* VEGAS. for many this is a good thing but I am burned out on Vegas. seems like almost every conference is here now.
* badge. it is just a printed piece of paper that you can't really show off when you get back home.
* low social media. HPE has some people doing social media, but they dont have a lounge for social media people can easily find. i had to have someone show me where it was. nor is our twitter handles on our badges.
* sometimes when trying to talk really techie about a product, the person HPE brought was the Program Manager and not a techie. so the technical discussion doesn't happen.  this is not wide spread but more often that I had hoped.

the one thing that I noticed is that HPE would bash (maybe too hard of a word) Dell without mentioned Dell.  it is obvious they are really concerned about Dell, especially post Dell-EMC merger.

it was a good conference and would go back again.
