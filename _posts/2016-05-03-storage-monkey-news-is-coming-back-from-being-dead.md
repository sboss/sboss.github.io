## I am not dead anymore!

for some of you old time friends know, I used to blog about storage a lot.  I was working in an environment/for a company that didn't mind.  then several years ago, I started working for a company that wasn't too blogger friendly.  so I retied the old site ( [storage-monkey.com](http://storage-monkey.com) ).  then recently a good friend of mine, Mark ( **[@dathbrun](https://twitter.com/dathbrun)** ) suggested that I bring the blog back.  now that I work for a company that doesn't mind if I blog, I agreed with him.  so when I went to resurrect the old site, I had let the domain name expire and a scummy registrar ( GoDaddy ) picked it up and wants over $5k for it.  I liked the name but **DAMN** that is too much.  so I purchased a new domain name ( storagemonkey.news ).

please keep a eye out here for my launch (soon).  I have several posts in my head that I need to write once I get the backend working (I am going to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)).  I will also post on twitter ( **[@the_sboss](https://twitter.com/the_sboss)** ) about the launch.


**UPDATE (2016-05-06):** some people have asked if I was going to resurrect the old data, blog, posts, or information.  *nope*, we are going fresh from now forward.  I want to look forward and not look back.  there is going to be too much *cool shit* (and that is a technical term) coming up that it will keep us busy and entertained.
