## we got some data on the merger at EMCWorld 2016

now when Joe Tucci and Michael Dell took stage, they talked about the merger and what is going to come out of it.  for the most part nothing really changes except of merging of some groups & some name changes.  *Dell Technologies* will be the parent name.  *Dell* will be the laptop/PC/small business line's name.  *Dell EMC* will be the enterprise & storage business line's name.  other companies like VMware, Pivotal, RSA, SecureWorks, etc won't change names.  or at least that is the plan now.

nothing there was a real shocker. it is good that Dell is keeping the brands that people already know.

**personal opinion** is this is a good thing for both Dell and EMC.  I liked how Dell took Dell private.  Now EMC will be private.  now they can focus more of their time/effort on pleasing & helping customers over worrying what *Wall Street* thinks.

only time will tell if it is a good or bad thing.
