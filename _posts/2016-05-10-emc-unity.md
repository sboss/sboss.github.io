## new mid-range storage array announced

![Unity](/public/img/EMC_Unity_front.png)

so this week at [EMCWorld](http://emcworld.com), EMC announced a new mid-range storage array.  **WHAT** another storage platform?  don't they already have mid-range with the VNX line?  *YES*, they do.  But unity is what the VNX line should have been all along.  Here are some of the highlights of the key features.

* 64-bit operating system from the ground up.
* truly unified for block, file and vVols.
* has an AFA version.
* **NO JAVA** plugin required to administer it.  **HTML5** based.
* has a full **REST API** to manage and monitor it.
* has a VSA option.
* builtin ESRS.
* 500 disk limit.

any one of these is not awesome sauce in itself.  but the combination it makes a really great storage array.  the DART operating system that powered the datamovers in the VNX was 32-bit and it was too much work to convert to 64-bit.  so having 64-bit now breaks down lots of the limitations of DART.

having a truly unified box, there is no more bolt on hardware like the datamovers and control station bolted onto the VNX to make it a unified box.  and the VNX truly isn't unified. unity is.

all storage platforms these days have to have an AFA (All Flash Array) model.  unity has them.  for each model of the unity it is either 100% flash (AFA model) or less than (or equal to) 50% flash.  soon (late this year I am predicting) the AFA model will be so cheap on a per-gigabyte cost that most people will just go AFA.

not having to use a java plugin is freaking amazing.  and the version of the plugin we would need was never the one you had loaded on your laptop so all of us storage administrator/engineers were upgrading/downgrading the plugin on a regular basis.  being **ALL HTML5** based means not more freaking plugins.  this makes me very happy.

for anyone that is into automation or having information in a custom location/format can rejoice as the platform has a full **REST API**.  it is the same API that the HTML5 UI uses.  now you can use things like puppet to automate the usage/allocation of storage on the array.  or if you are a large enterprise shop that has custom dashboards or monitoring tools or whatever, you can make calls to the REST API to populate your boards/screens.  I *love* REST APIs.

having a VSA option gives you several positive uses.  first off now you can deploy a (VSA) storage array in ROBO offices were you a very small foot print.  this allows your ROBO offices to have the same storage as the main office(s).  Ok that is cool but not earth shattering.  you can load up a VSA in your lab and allow your storage administrator(s) to get used to the new platform without any impact to production.  when they are done playing with it, just destroy the VM.  if you keep the storage allocated to the VSA to 4TB or less, you can use the VSA for **FREE**.  that is *awesome*.

for smaller locations you might not already have an ESRS setup.  if not, the unity can run a virtual-ESRS for it to use.  that virtual-ESRS won't support other arrays using it but it will fully support itself.  this is another win for ROBO.

now is the platform perfect? *never*.  there is limited compatibility between it and the VNX line.  so if you are on VNXs and want to migrate to the unity, you can't use things like MirrorView to move the data.  another drawback is it has a 500 disk limit on the largest model they have. that is a lot of media and lots of space but for some people they need more so they will have to stick with VNX for now.

I will write more about unity after I get one that I can beat on.
